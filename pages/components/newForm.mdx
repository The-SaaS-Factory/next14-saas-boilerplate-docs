## NewForm: Build Forms quickly
This component receives an array of objects that identify the fields that the form will have, inside it uses useForm to collect all the information and send it to the server action that we pass as a parameter. But nothing, it is very simple, powerful and fast

Example

```js
 const fields: Field[] = [
    {
      name: "name",
      label: "Name",
      type: "text",
      hasLanguageSupport: true,
      required: true,
    },
    ... // Others fields
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <NewForm
        values={[]}
        info={formInfo}
        fields={fields}
        modelToUpdate={null}
        onSubmit={upsertPlan} //Server Action
      />
    </>
  );
```
### values 
They are the values ​​of the model that we are going to update. For example, if we are going to update one of our membership plans... We must first obtain all the data of that plan with its id and send that array to newForm through the values ​​parameter. With this, NewForm will fill in all the fields

IMPORTANT: The name parameter of the fields must match the column of the table in question

### info
It is the header for the form, completely optional

### field 
The array of fields that the form receives has the following parameters
```json
 {
  name: string;
  label: string;
  type: string;
  slug?: string;
  numberStep?: string;
  note?: string;
  forceInteger?: boolean;
  required: boolean;
  options?: FieldSelectOption[]; // [optionName, optionValue]
  hasLanguageSupport?: boolean;
}
```
Supported Field Types: Text, Slug, Textarea, number, gallery, image, password, date, toggle, select, searchselect, multiselect, list , mapSelector

### modelToUpdate
When we are going to update, we must send part of the values ​​that we are going to fill in the form, also the id of the model that we are going to update. In this example it would be the ID of the plan that we are going to update

### onSubmit 
Server action prepared to work with the newForm
So that the information that is sent to the server action that we pass as a parameter works both to create and to update, it must follow the following scheme

Example with Plan Membership Model
```js
export const upsertPlan = async ({
  modelId,
  payload,
}: {
  modelId?: number;
  payload: Prisma.PlanCreateInput | Prisma.PlanUpdateInput;
}) => {
.....

 await prisma.plan.upsert({
      where: {
        id: modelId ? modelId : 0,
      },
      update: {
        name: payload.name,
        description: payload.description,
        status: payload.status,
      },
      create: {
        name: payload.name as string,
        description: payload.description as string,
        status: payload.status as string,
      },
    });
```
