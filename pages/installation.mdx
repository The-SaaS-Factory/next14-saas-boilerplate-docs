 <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The DATABASE_URL variable  is the connection string to your MySQL DB.
  Example: `mysql://root:root@localhost:3306/saas-boilerplate`
</Callout>

 
### Step 4
Run the prisma commands to push the schema to the database and generate the client.
 
```bash
npx prisma db push
```
### Step 5
Put some data in the database by running the seed command. (Recommended)
  
Run the seed 
```bash
npx prisma db seed  
```


### Step 6
Run the app in the development mode.
 
```bash
npm run dev --turbo
```
 

### Step 7
Configure Clerk
  
Create an new application in [https://dashboard.clerk.com/](https://dashboard.clerk.com/) 
 
 - Update in the .env file the "CLERK_SECRET_KEY", "NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY",  
 - Create an webhook and update the "CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET" in the .env file
 - Enable the Organizations option in the clerk's organizations panel
 
 <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
   For Clerk to send the information to your local project(Through webhook) and synchronize the database, you must expose your localhost with services such as ngrok or cloudflare
</Callout>

 <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
   Whatever tunneling service you use to expose your local host, it must end with this path: `/en/api/clerk`
</Callout>

 - Update the session token, go to the clerk dashboard and update the session token in the Customize session token section, put this
```json
{
	"metadata": "{{user.public_metadata}}"
}
```
<Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
   This is necessary for the User onboarding to work correctly
</Callout>

 
### Step 8

Create the Super Admin user: 
 In https://localhost:3000  create a new user

 In Clerk
- Go to https://dashboard.clerk.com/ and access to your Clerk App
- Edit the user and put in publicMetadata this: 
```json
{
  "isSuperAdmin": true,
  "permissions": ["superAdmin:totalAccess"]
}
```
  <Callout type="info" emoji="⚠️">
  For it to work we must have run seed or manually placed the permissions in the permissions table of our database
</Callout>
