 ## How to make a CRUD in 20 minutes
 One of the things we like most about the boilerplate and what saves us the most time is the **newForm** component. In this guide we are going to see how to implement it to make a crud in 20 minutes maximum.
 
### CRUD of a membership plan - EXAMPLE
The path where we have the crud frontend files is in

src/app/[locale]/(superAdmin)/admin/(billingModule)/billing/plans/plans

#### List
In the UI folder we have a component that lists the plans

    const BillingPlansList = async () => {
     const { data } = await getAllPlans(); //getAllPlans is a server action
We import this component in the page.tsx of our route folder
#### Create
To create and update we will use a single **UpsertPlan** file located in the UI folder since we are going to use it in /add and /edit two paths and two different files

```js copy {4,45}
import NewForm, { Field } from "@/components/core/NewForm";
import { upsertPlan } from "@/actions/superAdmin/superAdminBillingModule/upsert-plan";

const UpsertPlan = ({ planId, values }: { planId?: number; values?: any }) => {
  const formInfo = {
    name: "Create Plan",
    description: "Create a new plan for your organization",
  };

  const fields: Field[] = [
    {
      name: "name",
      label: "Name",
      type: "text",
      hasLanguageSupport: true,
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "status",
      label: "Status",
      type: "select",
      required: true,
      options: [
        {
          optionName: "Active",
          optionValue: "ACTIVE",
        },
        {
          optionName: "Inactive",
          optionValue: "INACTIVE",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      label: "Description",
      type: "textarea",
      required: true,
      hasLanguageSupport: true,
    },
  ];

  return (
    <>
      <NewForm
        values={values ?? []}
        info={formInfo}
        fields={fields}
        modelToUpdate={planId}
        onSubmit={upsertPlan}
      />
    </>
  );
};

export default UpsertPlan;
```
 planId, values:  They are injected into the UpsertPlan component when it is called on the edit page. These two variables tell newForm what to update and to set the form fields to the existing values
